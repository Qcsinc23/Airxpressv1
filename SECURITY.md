## 🎯 Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable MFA when available
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your browser and devices updated
- **Secure Networks**: Avoid public WiFi for sensitive operations
- **Account Monitoring**: Review account activity regularly

### For Developers

- **Code Reviews**: All code must be reviewed before merge
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability checks
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint with security rules
- **Environment Separation**: Strict dev/staging/production isolation
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions

### For Administrators

- **Regular Audits**: Periodic security assessments
- **Access Reviews**: Quarterly user access reviews
- **Incident Response**: Documented response procedures
- **Security Training**: Regular team security education
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security event monitoring

## 🔍 Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow

```
User → Clerk Auth → JWT Token → API Gateway → Protected Resources
```

### Authorization Levels

1. **Guest**: Quote viewing only
2. **User**: Create bookings, view own data
3. **Support**: Customer assistance capabilities
4. **Operations**: Shipment management functions
5. **Admin**: Full platform access and configuration

### Data Access Patterns

- **Customer Data**: Strict user isolation
- **Pricing Data**: Internal cost data never exposed
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable audit trail for all actions
- **Document Security**: S3 pre-signed URLs with expiration

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Data breach, system compromise | < 1 hour |
| **High** | Service disruption, data exposure | < 4 hours |
| **Medium** | Feature vulnerability, performance issue | < 24 hours |
| **Low** | Minor security concern | < 72 hours |

### Response Process

1. **Detection** - Automated monitoring and user reports
2. **Assessment** - Impact and severity evaluation
3. **Containment** - Immediate threat mitigation
4. **Investigation** - Root cause analysis
5. **Recovery** - System restoration and validation
6. **Communication** - User notification as appropriate
7. **Lessons Learned** - Process improvement

### Communication

- **Status Page**: Real-time incident updates
- **Email Notifications**: Critical security updates
- **In-App Alerts**: Important security messages
- **Post-Incident Reports**: Transparency for significant incidents
