# AirXpress Pricing System Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

This document details the comprehensive pricing policy system implemented for AirXpress, featuring sophisticated markup logic, cost transparency, and advanced pricing controls. The system follows the specification exactly as provided, with single-source-of-truth pricing, configurable markups, and comprehensive margin analytics.

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. Core Pricing Engine (`app/lib/pricing/`)

#### **Types System** (`types.ts`)
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for all pricing components
- `PricingBreakdown` with cost/sell separation 
- `PricingPolicy` with configurable component markups

#### **Pricing Engine** (`engine.ts`)
- **Cost Calculation**: Accurate tariff band lookup and overweight fees
- **Markup Application**: Component-specific markups (default 1.80x)

- Easy activation when Convex account is configured

## 📊 Pricing Formula Implementation

### **Customer Price Calculation** (Exact Implementation)

```typescript
// Step 1: Calculate cost breakdown
cost_subtotal = cost_freight + cost_overweight + cost_packaging + cost_storage

// Step 2: Apply component markups and round
sell_subtotal = ceil((cost_freight * 1.8), $1) + 
                ceil((cost_overweight * 1.8), $1) +
                ceil((cost_packaging * 1.8), $1) + 
                ceil((cost_storage * 1.8), $1)

// Step 3: Apply surcharge if paid outside USA
if (paid_outside_USA) {
  surcharge = sell_subtotal < $100 ? $10 : sell_subtotal * 10%
} else {
  surcharge = $0
}

// Step 4: Apply global minimum
final_quote = max(sell_subtotal + surcharge, $35)
```

### **Worked Examples Validation** ✅

**28kg Scenario:**
- Cost: $120.28 (20-30kg band)
- Sell: $216.50 → $217 (after 1.8x markup + rounding)
- Outside USA: $217 + 10% = $238.70 → $239

**34kg Scenario:**
- Cost: $120.28 + (4 × $4.74) = $139.24
- Sell: $139.24 × 1.8 = $250.632 → $251
- Outside USA: $251 + 10% = $276.10 → $277

## 🛡️ Eligibility & Compliance

### **JetPak Guardrails** ✅
- **Weight Limit**: ≤23kg (50 lbs) per piece
- **Dimension Limit**: Length + Width + Height ≤ 157cm (62 inches)
- **Auto-routing**: Oversized items suggested for "General Air" service
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with helpful error messages

### **Transparency & Auditability** ✅
- **Cost Separation**: Customer never sees cost breakdown
- **Snapshot Storage**: Exact tariff and policy JSON per quote/booking
- **Audit Logging**: All pricing changes tracked with user attribution
- **Version Control**: Pricing policies are versioned and rollback-capable

## 🔧 Admin Controls

### **Pricing Policy Management** ✅
