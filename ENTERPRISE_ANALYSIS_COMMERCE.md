- Cache invalidation cascades

// Solution: Event-Driven Architecture
- Real-time inventory webhooks
- Last-write-wins with conflict resolution
- Product availability caching (30s TTL)
- Price lock during checkout session
```

### **3. Performance & Scalability Thresholds**

#### **Database Performance Limits**
```typescript
// Convex Query Constraints:
MAX_QUERY_RESULTS: 1000 items per query
MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES: 100 per user session
INDEX_SCAN_LIMIT: 10000 documents
TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT: 10 seconds

// E-commerce Specific Concerns:
- Product catalog pagination (>1000 products)
- Cart queries with complex pricing
- Deal aggregation across multiple sources
- User session concurrent cart modifications
- Real-time inventory updates at scale
```

#### **Network & CDN Considerations**
```typescript
// Caribbean Infrastructure Challenges:
- High latency to US servers (200-500ms)
- Bandwidth limitations in rural areas
- Mobile-first user patterns
- Image optimization critical
- Progressive loading essential

// Solutions:
- Caribbean CDN edge locations
- Aggressive image compression (WebP)
- Critical resource preloading
- Offline-first cart functionality
- Mobile-optimized bundle sizes
```

### **4. Security Vulnerability Assessment**

#### **Payment Security (PCI DSS Compliance)**
```typescript
// Critical Security Requirements:
- Card data never touches application servers
- Stripe Elements for secure input
- TLS 1.3 for all payment communications
- Webhook signature verification
- User authorization on all payment operations

// Additional Commerce Risks:
- Price manipulation attacks
- Cart tampering via client modification
- Session hijacking during checkout
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- SQL injection through product search
```

#### **Data Protection & Privacy**
```typescript
// GDPR/Caribbean Privacy Laws:
- Explicit consent for marketing emails
- Right to deletion for EU customers
- Data residency for Caribbean customers
- Cookie consent management
- Personal data encryption at rest

// Implementation Requirements:
- User data anonymization capabilities
- Audit logging for data access
- Encryption for sensitive fields
- Geographic data restrictions
- Consent management workflows
```

## 🧪 **Edge Case Scenarios**

### **Boundary Conditions**
```typescript
// Product Catalog Edge Cases:
- Products with no dimensions/weight data
- Zero-price items or free samples
- Products exceeding shipping limits  
- Multi-part products requiring assembly
- Hazardous materials requiring special handling
- Seasonal availability changes
- Bulk discount thresholds

// Cart & Checkout Edge Cases:
- Empty cart checkout attempts
- Expired payment methods during checkout
- Address validation for remote Caribbean locations
