## ðŸš¨ **Critical Risk Mitigation Matrix**

### **High-Impact Scenarios**
```typescript
// Payment Processing Failure
Risk Level: CRITICAL
Impact: Customer charged, no order created
Mitigation: Idempotent operations + webhook reconciliation
Monitoring: Real-time payment status tracking
Recovery: Automated refund + manual order creation

// External API Complete Failure  
Risk Level: HIGH
Impact: No new products available
Mitigation: Cached inventory + manual product entry
Monitoring: API health checks every 30 seconds
Recovery: Failover to backup data sources

// Database Connection Exhaustion
Risk Level: HIGH  
Impact: Complete service unavailability
Mitigation: Connection pooling + read replicas
Monitoring: Connection count alerting
Recovery: Auto-scaling + connection recycling
```

### **Compliance & Legal Requirements**
```typescript
// Data Residency (Caribbean)
Requirement: Customer data stored locally where required
Implementation: Geographic data routing
Validation: Regular compliance audits
Monitoring: Data location tracking

// PCI DSS Compliance
Requirement: Level 1 merchant compliance
Implementation: Stripe SAQ-A certification
Validation: Quarterly security scans
Monitoring: Continuous vulnerability assessment
```

This comprehensive enterprise analysis ensures every technical constraint, security vulnerability, performance threshold, and regulatory requirement is addressed before implementation begins. The phased approach allows for iterative validation and risk mitigation at each stage.
