# Compliance Notes (Non-Legal)
- **Known Shipper**: Disclose KS status and that security screening is performed by partner IAC/airline programs until IAC approval.
- **Documentation**: Always provide commercial invoice/packing list; for Guyana, guide users to official customs resources for personal effects (e.g., C73 vs. full entry). Do not provide legal advice.
