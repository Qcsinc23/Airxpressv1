```

## üö® **Critical Failure Mode Analysis**

### **Data Integrity Failure Scenarios**
```typescript
// Scenario 1: Partial Cart Checkout Failure
Risk: User payment succeeds but order creation fails
Impact: Customer charged without order record
Mitigation: 
- Idempotent order creation with payment intent ID
- Webhook-based reconciliation process
- Manual refund workflow for orphaned payments
- Customer communication automation

// Scenario 2: Inventory Overselling
Risk: Multiple users purchase last available item
Impact: Unfulfillable orders, customer dissatisfaction
Mitigation:
- Inventory reservation during checkout (15-minute timeout)
- Real-time stock validation before payment capture
- Backorder workflow with customer notification
- Automatic substitution suggestions

// Scenario 3: Pricing Calculation Errors
Risk: Shipping costs miscalculated due to API failures
Impact: Incorrect pricing leading to losses or customer complaints
Mitigation:
- Pricing validation against multiple sources
- Manual pricing override capabilities
- Price protection during checkout session
- Automated price discrepancy alerts
```

### **Security Vulnerability Assessment**

#### **Input Validation & Sanitization**
```typescript
// Attack Vector Analysis:
1. Product Search XSS - Malicious scripts in search queries
2. Price Manipulation - Client-side cart total modification
3. SQL Injection - Product filter parameter injection
4. File Upload Attacks - Malicious product images
5. Session Fixation - Cart hijacking attacks
6. CSRF Attacks - Unauthorized purchase actions

// Defense Implementation:
- Zod schema validation for ALL inputs
- Server-side price recalculation on checkout
- Parameterized queries only (Convex prevents SQL injection)
- File type validation and virus scanning
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Secure session management via Clerk
```

#### **PCI DSS Compliance Requirements**
```typescript
// Level 1 Merchant Requirements:
- Annual external security audit
- Quarterly vulnerability scans
- Network segmentation for card data
- Encryption of cardholder data at rest/transit
- Regular penetration testing
- Incident response plan

// Implementation Strategy:
- Stripe handles all card data (SAQ-A compliance)
- TLS 1.3 minimum for all communications
- No card data storage in application
- Webhook signature verification mandatory
- Access logging for all payment operations
```

## üåê **Caribbean Market Considerations**
