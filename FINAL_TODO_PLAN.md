## 🔍 **Critical Decision Points**

### **Architecture Decisions Requiring Validation**
1. **Inventory Model**: Real-time vs eventual consistency trade-offs
2. **Payment Priority**: Stripe vs MMG as primary for different regions  
3. **Data Residency**: Caribbean data center vs US with compliance
4. **Offline Capability**: Full offline vs critical path only
5. **Search Implementation**: Convex built-in vs external Algolia

### **Business Rules Requiring Clarification**
1. **Shipping Integration**: All products require shipping quotes or flat rates?
2. **Pricing Strategy**: Dynamic pricing vs fixed margins for deals?
3. **Returns Policy**: Physical return shipping vs credit-only for deals?
4. **Multi-Currency**: Dynamic FX rates vs daily fixed rates?
5. **Tax Calculation**: Real-time vs pre-calculated tax tables?

This comprehensive plan ensures enterprise-grade implementation with full coverage of technical constraints, security requirements, performance thresholds, and regulatory compliance while maintaining the existing AirXpress design consistency.
